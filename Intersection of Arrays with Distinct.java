// Given two unsorted integer arrays a[] and b[] each consisting of distinct elements, the task is to return the count of elements in the intersection (or common elements) of the two arrays.
// Intersection of two arrays can be defined as the set containing distinct common elements between the two arrays. 

// Examples:
// Input: a[] = [89, 24, 75, 11, 23], b[] = [89, 2, 4]
// Output: 1
// Explanation: 89 is the only element in the intersection of two arrays.

// Input: a[] = [1, 2, 4, 3, 5, 6], b[] = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
// Output: 4
// Explanation: 3, 4, 5, and 6 are the elements in the intersection of two arrays.

// Input: a[] = [20, 10, 30, 50, 40], b[] = [15, 25, 30, 20, 35]
// Output: 2
// Explanation: 20 and 30 are the elements in the intersection of the two arrays.


// Constraints:
// 1  ≤  a.size(), b.size() ≤  105
// 1  ≤  a[i], b[i]  ≤  105
